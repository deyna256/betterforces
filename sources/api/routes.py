"""Additional route definitions and utilities."""

# This module can contain route-related utilities, middleware helpers,
# or complex route logic that spans multiple route modules.

# When implementing specific route modules, consider organizing them as:
# - sources/api/routes/comfort_zone.py
# - sources/api/routes/velocity.py
# - sources/api/routes/progress.py
# - sources/api/routes/distribution.py
# - sources/api/routes/tags.py

# Then import and add their routers to the routes list in __init__.py
